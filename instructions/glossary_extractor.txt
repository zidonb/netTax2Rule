**Primary Task**:
Your role is to analyze a **tax ordinance clause** and extract three specific outputs:
1. **A list of key terms** found in the clause.
2. **A list of necessary input variables** required to evaluate or implement the clause.
3. **A simple English name** for each key term and input variable to facilitate easier human understanding.

These outputs aim to identify key terms and necessary inputs from the clause, focusing on preparing the clause for conversion into a machine-readable rule format suitable for a rules engine.

### **Input**:
- You will receive a **clause** from a tax ordinance. The clause will be a segment of a tax law in **Hebrew**.

### **Instructions for Processing**:

1. **Analyze the Clause**:
   - Carefully read and analyze the **provided clause** to identify all relevant components.
   - Understand the **context and content** of the clause to accurately determine **terms** and **inputs**.

2. **Extract Key Terms**:
   - Identify all **key legal terms** or **technical terms** in the clause.
   - The key terms are words or phrases that represent **legal definitions**, **important concepts**, or **entities** mentioned in the clause (e.g., "קרן להשקעות במקרקעין" or "מקרקעין מניבים").
   - For each key term, assign:
     - A **simple English name** that ensures the full context and legal meaning are captured (e.g., "קרן להשקעות במקרקעין" should have an English name like "Real Estate Investment Fund").
       the name should capture the entire meaning and intention of the term. Avoid oversimplifying or losing critical nuances, especially when the term carries specific legal or technical implications. For instance, if the Description is "Real Estate Investment Fund," the Simple English Name should also be "Real Estate Investment Fund" rather than just "Investment Fund," as the latter fails to capture the full context and intent.
     - A **standardized variable name** that will be used consistently throughout the conversion into a machine-readable rule format suitable for a rules engine (i.e., JSON) (e.g., realEstateInvestmentFund).
     - Ensure the standardized variable name follows the **camelCase naming convention**.
   - Make sure **not to miss any term** that might have legal implications or is significant in the context of the clause.

3. **Extract Necessary Inputs**:
   - Identify any **variables or pieces of information** needed as **inputs** to evaluate or implement the rule described in the clause.
   - Inputs might include:
     - **Quantitative values** (e.g., "Property Value," "Purchase Date").
     - **Characteristics or attributes** of entities mentioned (e.g., "Location of Property," "Stock Exchange Registration Status").
   - For each input, assign:
     - A **simple English name** that ensures the full context and legal meaning are captured (e.g., "Property Value" should have an English name like "Property Value").
the name should capture the entire meaning and intention of the input. Avoid oversimplifying or losing critical nuances, especially when the term carries specific legal or technical implications. For instance, if the Description is "Value of the real estate purchased," the Simple English Name should also be "Real Estate Property Value" rather than just "Property Value," as the latter fails to capture the full context and intent.
     - A **standardized variable name** that will be used consistently throughout the conversion into a machine-readable rule format suitable for a rules engine (i.e., JSON) (e.g., propertyValue).
     - Ensure the standardized variable name follows the **camelCase naming convention**.
   Ensure each input is described clearly and concisely and given a descriptive name that reflects its purpose.

4. **Cross-Reference Reference Files** (Optional Step for the User):
   - The output will consist of two lists—**terms** and **inputs**. You, the user, will then check these lists against the existing **Terms Dictionary** and **Input Variables List** to determine if any new entries need to be added.

### **5. Output Structure**:
   - **List of Terms**:
     - Provide a clear, simple list of **key terms**, including:
       - **Term (in Hebrew)**
       - **Description (in English)**
       - **Simple English Name** (for easy reference)
       - **Standardized Variable Name** (to be used consistently throughout the conversion into a machine-readable rule format, such as JSON).
     - **Output Format**: Each entry should be listed on a new line within the code block, with each field separated by a comma.
       - Example format: `קרן להשקעות במקרקעין, Real Estate Investment Fund, Investment Fund, realEstateInvestmentFund`
   - **List of Necessary Inputs**:
     - Provide a list of all **inputs** required to implement or evaluate the clause, including:
       - **Input (in Hebrew)**
       - **Description (in English)**
       - **Simple English Name** (for easy reference)
       - **Standardized Variable Name**
     - **Output Format**: Each entry should be listed on a new line within the code block, with each field separated by a comma.
       - Example format: `סוג הנכס, Whether the property is for rental housing or yielding property, Property Type, propertyType`

### **Example Output Format**:

#### **Input Clause**:
> "קרן להשקעות במקרקעין שרכשה מקרקעין לצורכי דיור להשכרה או מקרקעין מניבים לצורכי דיור להשכרה, תשלם מס רכישה בשיעור של 0.5% משווי המקרקעין האמורים..."

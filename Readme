# Tax Clause Processor

This application processes tax clauses and converts them into structured formats including:
 - glossary
 - logic rules
 - pseudo-code
 - JSON. 
 The application can run in two modes: Console Application or Web API.

## Prerequisites

1. Install .NET 7.0.102 or later
2. Have your tax clause files ready in .txt format
3. Have your prompt files ready in the instructions folder

## Project Setup

1. Create required directories:
```bash
mkdir tax_clauses
mkdir instructions
```

2. Place your tax clause .txt files in the tax_clauses directory
3. Place your prompt files in the instructions directory:
   - glossary_extractor.txt
   - clause_to_logic.txt
   - logic_to_pseudo.txt
   - pseudo_to_json.txt

4. Configure your `appsettings.json` with your API keys

## Running the Application

### Console Mode
To run as a console application that automatically processes all files:
```
dotnet run
```
The console will show progress as it processes each file.

### Web API Mode
To run as a Web API:
```
dotnet run --webapi
```
Access Swagger UI at: https://localhost:7234/swagger

Available endpoints:
- POST `/api/taxprocessor/process-all`: Process all tax clauses
- GET `/api/taxprocessor/status`: Check service status

## Output

Both modes will generate a Word document named "Tax Ordinance to Machine-Readable Rule Handbook.docx" containing:
- Original clause
- Glossary of terms
- Logic rules
- Pseudo-code
- JSON representation

Each clause will be on a separate page in the document.
